Algorithm (Pseudo-code)
CopyMain Program:
1. Create CookieSalesTracker
2. While there is input:
   - Read classId and boxesSold
   - Process sale through tracker
3. Generate and write report

ProcessSale(classId, boxes):
1. Search for existing ClassSales in list
2. If found:
   - Update total boxes
3. If not found:
   - Create new ClassSales
   - Add to list
   - Update total boxes

FindWinners():
1. Initialize maxBoxes to 0
2. For each ClassSales in list:
   - If totalBoxes > maxBoxes:
     - Clear winners list
     - Add current class to winners
     - Update maxBoxes
   - If totalBoxes == maxBoxes:
     - Add current class to winners
3. Return winners list
